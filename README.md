## Alternative Setup Methods

### A. Using LangGraph CLI
1. Install the `uv` package manager:
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ```bash
   langgraph up
   ```

### B. Using Google Gemini Instead of OpenAI
